# CodeCell Component

## Overview

The `CodeCell` component is an integral part of the notebook-style interface, designed for interactive code editing and execution. It leverages the power of CodeMirror for a rich text editing experience and integrates with ourthe application's collaborative and execution features.

## Key Functionalities

### Code Editing:

- Utilizes CodeMirror for a sophisticated code editing experience.
- Supports syntax highlighting for JavaScript and Python, adaptable for other languages.
- Includes features like auto-completion, code formatting, and custom key bindings.

### Collaborative Editing:

- Integrates with `y-codemirror.next` for real-time collaborative editing.
- Displays cursor positions and selections of other users in real-time.

### Code Execution:

- Executes code with a custom backend service (`handleDredd`).
- Displays output and execution status within the component.
- Supports asynchronous execution handling.

### Theming and Customization:

- Adapts to light and dark themes based on the notebook's theme.
- Customizable editor theming and appearance.

### Responsive and Interactive UI:

- Includes a toolbar for actions like running code.
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and layouts.

## Example Usage

```jsx
<CodeCell cellId='uniqueCellId' cell={cellData} />
```

- `cellId`: A unique identifier for the cell.
- `cell`: An object containing cell-specific data like content, metadata, and output.

## Implementation Details

The component uses `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for state management and side effects. `useRef` is used to maintain references to the CodeMirror editor instance and the cell element. Collaborative features are managed using `yCollab` from `y-codemirror.next`. The `handleRunCode` function is responsible for executing the code and updating the output. Custom styling is applied through CSS modules and dynamic class names based on the theme.

## `createCodeEditor` Function

This function initializes a CodeMirror editor instance with custom settings:

- Sets up key bindings for code execution and formatting.
- Configures language-specific syntax highlighting and autocompletion.
- Applies theming based on the notebook's theme and output presence.
